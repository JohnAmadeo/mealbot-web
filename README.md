# Intro (for people new to Javascript / React)
- [Learn Javascript](https://javascript.info/)
- [Introduction to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
- Download NPM [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). NPM is the piece of software that lets developers download Javascript libraries/modules/packages 
- If curious, this project was setup with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Getting Started
- Run 'npm install' to install all of the project's dependencies
- Congifure 'api.js' to decide whether you want talk to the production backend, or a local backend (you need to clone & build github.com/johnamadeo/mealbot if you want to run the backend on your local machine)
- Run 'npm start'
